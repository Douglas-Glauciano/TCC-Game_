"None of the lenses are perfect, and none are complete, but each is useful in one
context or another, for each gives a unique perspective on your design. The idea is
that even though we can’t have one complete picture, by taking all of these small
imperfect lenses and using them to view your problem from many different perspectives, you will be able to use your discretion to figure out the best design. I wish we
had one all-seeing lens. We don’t. So, instead of discarding the many imperfect ones
we do have, it is wisest to collect and use as wide a variety of them as possible, for
as we will see, game design is more art than science, more like cooking than chemistry, and we must admit the possibility that our Mendeleev will never come."
    ~Jesse Schell ("The art of game Design")


 Magic Words
Would-be designers often ask me, “How do you become a game designer? ” And the
answer is easy: “Design games. Start now! Don’t wait! Don’t even finish this conversation! Just start designing! Go! Now! ”
And some of them do just that. But many have a crisis of confidence, and feel
stuck in a catch-22: If only game designers can design games, and you can only
become a game designer by designing games, how can anyone ever get started? If
this is how you feel, the answer is easy. Just say these magic words:
I am a game designer
I’m serious. Say them out loud, right now. Don’t be shy — there’s no one here
but us. 
Did you do it? If so, congratulations. You are now a game designer. You might
feel, at this moment, that you aren’t really a game designer yet, but that you’rejust
pretending to be one. And that’s fine, because as we’ll explore later, people become
what they pretend to be. Just go on pretending, doing the things you think a game
designer would do, and before long, to your surprise, you will find you are one. If
your confidence wavers, just repeat the magic words again: I am a game designer .
Sometimes, I repeat them like this:
 Who are you?
I am a game designer .
 No, you’re not.
I am a game designer .
 What kind of a designer?
I am a game designer .
 You mean you play games.
I am a game designer .
This game of confidence building may seem silly at first. But it is far from the silliest thing you will do as a designer. And it is terribly important that you get good at
building your confidence, for doubts about your abilities will forever plague you. As a
novice designer, you will think “I’ve never done this — I don’t know what I’m doing. ”
Once you have a little experience, you will think “My skills are so narrow — this new
title is different. Maybe I just got lucky last time. ” And when you are a seasoned
designer, you will think “The world is different now. Maybe I’ve lost my touch. ”
Blow away these useless thoughts. They can’t help you. When a thing must be
attempted, one must never think about possibility or impossibility. If you look at
the great creative minds, all so different, you will find they have one thing in common: They lack a fear of ridicule. Some of the greatest innovations have come from
people who only succeeded because they were too dumb to know that what they
were doing was impossible. Game design is decision making, and decisions must be
made with confidence.
 Will you fail sometimes? Yes you will. You will fail again, and again, and again.
You will fail many, many more times than you will succeed. But these failures are
your only path to success. You will come to love your failures, because each failure
brings you a step closer to a truly phenomenal game. There is a saying among jugglers: “If you aren’t dropping, you aren’t learning. And if you aren’t learning, you
aren’t a juggler. ” The same is true for game design: If you aren’t failing, you aren’t
trying hard enough, and you aren’t really a game designer
